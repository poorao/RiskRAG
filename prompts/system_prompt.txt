Consider the following definitions: 
    1) An AI incident is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly leads to any of the following harms: (a) injury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people; (b) disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; (c) violations to human rights or a breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights; (d) harm to property, communities or the environment.' The harm can be physical, psychological, reputational, economic/financial (including harm to property), environmental, public interest (e.g., protection of critical infrastructure and democratic institutions), human rights and fundamental rights. 
    2) An AI risk is expressed as likelihood that harm or damage will occur. Risk is a function of both the probability of an event occurring and the severity of the consequences that would result. Risk is usually expressed in terms of risk sources, potential events, their consequences and their likelihood.
